== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After installing the Plugin, I just see a blank page. =

This can happen if you have huge number of posts and your server is very underpowered. Check your PHP error log to see if there are any errors and correct them. The most common problems are script timeout or running out of memory. Change your PHP.ini file and increase the script timeout and/or amount of memory used by PHP process. 

In particular try to change the following settings

*   `max_execution_time = 600` - Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
*   `max_input_time = 30` - Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
*   `memory_limit = 256M` - Maximum amount of memory a script may consume

= Temporary files directory "/wp-book/vendor/mpdf/mpdf/src/Config/../../tmp" is not writable issue. =

This can happen when the plugin's tmp directory does not have write permission. You need to setup 777 permission for tmp directory. 

Its located `/wp-content/plugins/wp-book/vendor/mpdf/mpdf/tmp`
